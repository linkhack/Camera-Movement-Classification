# Camera Movement Classification: A fundamental base for automatic video analysis
## Introduction
This project tries to classify movie shots based on the camera movement. We wish to classify the video into
one of the three classes pan, tilt and tracking. Pan is a horizontal rotation, tilt is a vertical rotation of the camera.
Tracking is filming from a moving platform.

The data stems from the digitalization of historical videos from around the second world war. The quality and camera
parameters can widely vary from shot to shot. The dataset can be found on http://efilms.ushmm.org/
and https://imediacities.hpc.cineca.it/.
